# CS-340 Project Two Web Application Dashboard Description

This course focused on building applications that interface client-side code with database systems. Some key topics we learned about included NoSQL databases (MongoDB), Python integration, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and API development, which ended in a final web application project. 

The objective of this project was to create a functional Python web application dashboard that makes viewing data from a separate MongoDB database easier, using Dash and a Python “middleware” interface. The interface was meant to streamline CRUD operations between the MongoDB database and the Python dashboard, allowing the user to quickly and easily access information about dogs available to train for a variety of rescue operations. The original code was in an online virtual space I no longer have access to, but there are screenshots in the file in this repo with the code I created and the results they produced.
